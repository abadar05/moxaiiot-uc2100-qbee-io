# Industrial IoT on a shoestring -Solution Architecture (Python)

![](media/solution-architecture-v3.png)
IIoT on Shoestring Project is community driven open source project (MIT License). It is designed to run on low cost small footprint embedded gateways like Moxa UC-2100 series with device managment capabilities (remote access, remote OTA updates, remote configuration, CI/CD)
- It well designed de-coupled software architecture using mosquitto broker
- Ready to use pub/sub secure MQTT client interface 
- Pure python3 implementation
- Pure MQTT implementation based on paho-mqtt
- Ready to use Modbus TCP and Modbus RTU interface
- Ready to use AWS IoT Core Interface to publish telemetry 
- Qbee provides remotes access and device management capabilities
